It`s demo of a website designed for writting articles. Now it has several functional options. There are some of it:
1) writting an article and adding it to articles library;
2) contact with a developer.

In the near future I`ll upload upgrades for more options to interact. 

For correct using of the code you should install:
1) gorilla  - use this link for guide: https://github.com/gorilla/mux;
2) Go MySQL - use this link for guide: https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql.
